# Netflix Recommendation System

This project involves building a recommendation system that suggests movies based on user preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering techniques to analyze user ratings and recommend movies that align with the tastes of similar users. The model was developed using Python, Flask, and JavaScript, and it integrates with The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch additional movie details like ratings, genres, and cast information.

The recommendation system processes and cleans data from large datasets, including over 5,000 lines of data across 6 CSV files. The web interface, built with Flask and enhanced with HTML and CSS, allows users to interact with the recommendation system in real-time, providing a seamless and intuitive experience. This project showcases the practical application of machine learning in a real-world scenario, creating personalized recommendations that enhance user experience.
